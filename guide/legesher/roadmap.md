# Roadmap Breakdown

For any project within the Legesher portfolio or any new project that is added, they will all follow this similar guideline and flow.

## Issue Labels

For issues in any repository, they follow the same conventions in terms of the labels that are available. They follow the same style guide for consistency sake across projects.

We group labels by color, according to broad themes. Labels are consistent across repositories, except for a few repository specific concepts. This is for the purpose of making the process of creating new issues and contributing to any repository in the Legesher portfolio easy and consistent.
